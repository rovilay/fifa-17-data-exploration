It majorly classifies the data into groups (According to how i felt it necessary) ,The groups are based on: Country, Club, Position, Age, Ratings.

  <h2> Data visualization(1)</h2>
  <section> This section is focuses on displaying the dataset visually, so as to enhance the understanding of the dataset as a whole. it shows population of players from different countries. the countries are classified based on continents. Also only top 10 countries of each continents are chosen for graphical illustration. It must be noted that the coountries in each continents are based on the football association of each continents i.e
  Asia – Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
  1. Africa – Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF)
  2. North and Central America and the Caribbean – 
  3. Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)
  4. South America – Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL)
  5. Europe - Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
  6. Oceania - Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)
   Also new Zealand was added to AFC due to very low population of other countries in the OFC.
   Again, the same y-axis limitation (0-1000)was used for all graphs even if it would have been more clear to use limitations that best suits each graphs, but this is so as to ensure uniformity and also enhance faster comparisons across conitnents in a glance.</section>

 <h2> Data visualization(2)</h2>
 <section>This section focus on this playing the population of each countries based on each rating group on a map i.e each country when hovered on the map displays the population of rating group. There are 3 maps display which represents the age group (Youngster (17-24), Normal(25 -30 for outfield players and 25-31 for goalkeepers ), old( 31- for outfield players and 32- for goalkeepers)) </section>

 <h2> Data visualization(3)</h2>
 <section> This section focus on represent various graphical datas like %population of each age in fifa 17,  Ranking of clubs and countries based on ratings, Top 200 players.
 NOte: the ranking by country isn't valid because countries with lesser population have the advantage over countries with higher population despite the latter having higher ratings but the average suggests otherwise.</section>
